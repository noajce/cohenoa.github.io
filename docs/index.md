# Noa Cohen's page

I recently got to know [Gabor Szabo](https://github.com/szabgab/) through a shared colleague. Luckily, he invited me to join his course [OSDC - Open Source Development Course](https://osdc.code-maven.com/), where I learned how to create github pages using my github repository.

I'm a bioinformatician, studying various topics of computational biology and teaching relebant courses at the Azrieli College of Engineering.
I am currently building my academic page, also using github pages. I used a theme for academic purposes nd it looks great (still under construction):  [cohenoa-lab.github.io](https://cohenoa-lab.github.io)

The published open-source packages can be found here: [cohenoa's github repository](https://github.com/cohenoa/), but there are more details in [cohenoa-lab.github.io](https://cohenoa-lab.github.io). 

## Some more info:
* [my profile - dev.to](https://dev.to/cohenoa/)
* [my CV](/cv)

## Miscellaneous 
* Here is an origami model that I folded may years ago, using the instructions by [Jo Nakashima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbXG4XugaYM).
